intro:
  - excerpt: 'An <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> graduate, currently I am a 
  graduate student pursuing my doctorate in 
  <a href="http://mechanical.illinois.edu/">Mechanical Sciences</a> at the 
  <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, following a 
  Masters degree in December 2019. Currently a member of 
  <a href="https://mattia-lab.com/">Gazzola Lab</a>, I am deeply passionate about exploring 
  and understanding, using computational and theoretical tools, the physics involving 
  flow--structure interaction (FSI), multiphase phenomena,
  interplay between elasticity and fluid dynamics of FSI systems and continuum viscoelasticity.
  Besides research, I love to travel across borders and enjoy playing badminton and soccer.
