Currently a member of <a href="https://mattia-lab.com/">Gazzola Lab</a>, I am deeply
passionate about exploring and understanding, using computational and theoretical tools,
the physics involving flow--structure interaction (FSI), multiphase phenomena,
interplay between elasticity and fluid dynamics of FSI systems and continuum viscoelasticity.
Below, you can find brief descriptions of the research domains I'm involved in:
