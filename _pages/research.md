Currently a member of <a href="https://mattia-lab.com/">Gazzola Lab</a>, I am deeply
passionate about exploring and understanding, using computational and theoretical tools,
the physics involving flow--structure interaction (FSI), multiphase phenomena,
interplay between elasticity and fluid dynamics of FSI systems and continuum viscoelasticity.
Below, you can find brief descriptions of the research domains I'm involved in:

## Soft/rigid body flow-structure interaction

Accurate and versatile solvers are the key to shed light on and dissect underlying physics in
FSI systems presenting body elasticity/compliance, with potential applications in medicine, soft
robotics, flow control and inertial microfluidics. With that in mind, my recent venture at
[Gazzola Lab](https://mattia-lab.com/) with the help of my colleague
[Tejaswin Parthasarathy](https://parthas1.github.io/) has led to the development of a robust, 
flexible numerical algorithm for solving incompressible flowâ€“structure interaction problems
for mixed rigid/soft body representations, within a consistent framework based on the
remeshed vortex method. The preprint detailing our study with the algorithm, benchmarks and
illustrations can be found here [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09669.pdf) with one of the
illustration cases shown below: a rigid cylinder falling on an elastic trampoline, with both
bodies submerged in a viscous fluid.

## Viscous streaming

Viscous streaming refers to the time-averaged steady flow that arises when an immersed body
of characteristic length scale *D* undergoes small-amplitude oscillations (compared to *D)*
in a viscous fluid. With the broad range of applications of viscous streaming in microfluidic
flow manipulation, particle trapping, scalar transport and passive swimming, our understanding
of how streaming flow features and topology are affected by multiple body length scales remains
largely incomplete. In my Master's thesis work, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms
at play, when streaming flow topology is manipulated via regulated variations of shape geometry,
thus providing a rational design approach for microfluidic applications. Our work, which can be
found [here](/assets/paps/curv.pdf) has been published recently in ***Journal of Fluid Mechanics***,
with a glimpse of the effects of geometric variation on streaming flows shown below:
